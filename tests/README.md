   - Added tests for initialization
   - Added tests for template selection
   - Added tests for structure prompt creation
   - Added tests for JSON structure parsing
   - Added tests for text structure parsing

   - Added tests for content generation
   - Added tests for text formatting

3. **report_tasks.py**: Added initial test coverage
   - Added tests for SqlAlchemyTask class
   - Added tests for session handling

## Next Steps

The following modules still have low coverage and should be prioritized for additional testing:

1. **web_research_agent.py**: 17% coverage
2. **report_tasks.py**: 14% coverage
3. **websockets/manager.py**: 31% coverage
4. **routers/websockets.py**: 33% coverage
5. **routers/reports.py**: 37% coverage

## Testing Approach

Tests were implemented using:
- pytest
- unittest.mock for patching and mocking
- AsyncMock for asynchronous functions
- Proper test isolation to avoid external dependencies
- pytest fixtures for common test setup
